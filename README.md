# rerum_server
Java web service for a RERUM compliant digital object repository.
Visit [rerum.io](http://rerum.io) for more general information.

Stores important bits of knowledge in structured JSON-LD objects:

* Web Annotation / Open Annotation objects
* SharedCanvas / International Image Interoperability Framework objects
* FOAF Agents
* _any_ valid JSON object, even if there is no type specified!

## Basic Principles

1. **As RESTful as is reasonable**—accept and respond to a broad range of requests without losing the map;
1. **As compliant as is practical**—take advantage of standards and harmonize conflicts;
1. **Save an object, retrieve an object**—store metadata in private (`__rerum`) property, rather than wrap all data transactions;
1. **Trust the application, not the user**—avoid multiple login and authentication requirements and honor open data attributions;
1. **Open and Free**—expose all contributions immediately without charge to write or read;
1. **Attributed and Versioned**—always include asserted ownership and transaction metadata so consumers can evaluate trustworthiness and relevance.

## What we add

You will find a `__rerum` property on anything you read from this repository. This is written onto
all objects by the server and is not editable by the client applications. While applications may assert
_anything_ within their objects, this property will always tell the Truth. The details are in the
documentation, but broadly, you will find:

* `@context`   the RERUM API JSON-LD context file for these terms
* `alpha`  internal flag for RERUM API version control 
* `APIversion` specific RERUM API release version for this data node
* `createdAt`  specific creation date for this \[version of this] object
* `generatedBy`  the agent for the application that authenticated to create this object
* `isOverwritten`  specific date (if any) this version was updated without versioning
* `isReleased`  a special flag for RERUM, indicating this version is intentionally public and immutable
* `releases`  an object containing the most recent anscestor and descendant releases
* `history`  an object containing the first, previous, and immediate derivative versions of this object

## Who is to blame?

The developers at the Walter J. Ong, <sub><sup>S.J.</sup></sub> Center for Digital Humanities authored and maintain this service.
Neither specific warranty or rights are associated with RERUM; registering and contributing implies only those rights 
each object asserts about itself. We welcome sister instances of RERUM, ports to other languages, package managers, builds, etc.
